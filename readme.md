# FluentConf Notes
Taking notes at [FluentConf](http://fluentconf.com)? Then clone this repo and add your notes. Push them to github, and everybody else will be able to make use of them/add extra notes.

Formats that github understands (like markdown) are great, but whatever you take notes with is good too.
